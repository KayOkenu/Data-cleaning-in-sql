Data Cleaning In SQL Project.


This repository contains cods and data for a data cleaning project to prepare a dataset for analysis and ensuring data reliability. SQL techniques were applied using a Nashville Housing Ownership dataset. 

Highlights:
Data wrangling was conducted extensively to prepare the dataset for analysis. Advanced SQL techniques such as CASE statements, JOINS and Common Table Expressions (CTEs) were utilized in the transformation and cleaning of the dataset.

This project contains code to:
1. Standardize data formats
2. Populate null columns
3. Break house addresses into different columns (that is, into address, city and state from a full address)
4. Change Y and N to Yes and No in the necessary field
5. Check and eliminate duplicate values
6. Delete unused columns
